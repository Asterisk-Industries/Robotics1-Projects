  This folder includes Matlab code used for open and closed loop control of our Duckiebot. 
It requires Robot Raconteur, and for the specific IP address of the Duckiebot to be 
manually hardcoded into the connect function in duck_move2.m and parallel_park.m. Besides 
that, as long as all files are in the path it should run fine.
